"Whales are fast swimmers in comparison to seals, which typically cruise at 5–15 kn, or 9–28 kilometres per hour (5.6–17.4 mph); the fin whale, in comparison, can travel at speeds up to 47 kilometres per hour (29 mph) and the sperm whale can reach speeds of 35 kilometres per hour (22 mph)",B-ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ANIMAL O O O O O O O O O O
